somebody said shelly sells signalling socket servers so small she stands seven centimeters south as sand shifting sounds shouldn't sink simple cellar shelves

this is a very simple (functioning) example of an rtc signalling socket server

it works with cani-rtc, which establishes a dataChannel connection through this

just for fun!
